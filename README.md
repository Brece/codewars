In this repository I'm posting my solutions to coding challenges on **[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)**.

The main goal is to keep track of my consistency in improving my ability to solve problems.

## Install packages:
```
npm install
```

## Install typescript (if it's missing):
```
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

## Create tsconfig.json file (if it's missing):
```
npx tsc --init
```

## Start "tsc watch" to compile to JS file on save:
```
Mac: Shift+Cmd+B and select tsc:watch task
Windows: Shift+Ctrl+B
```

## Run Jest testing a specific file:
```
npx jest testName.test.js 
```
